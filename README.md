ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics
Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science techniques. As a graduate student pursuing opportunities in Actuarial Science, I'm building practical skills that combine the rigor of econometric thinking with the power of machine learning.

🎯 About This Portfolio
This collection represents my coursework and laboratory projects from ECON 5200, where I'm learning to integrate two powerful analytical frameworks:

Causal Inference: Understanding the why behind economic relationships using econometric methods
Predictive Analytics: Leveraging machine learning to forecast outcomes and uncover patterns in complex datasets

The course follows a "Concept Extension" philosophy—we start with foundational statistical concepts (like ordinary least squares regression) and scale them up using modern ML algorithms (like Lasso regression and ensemble methods). This approach helps me understand not just how to use these tools, but when and why they're appropriate for different economic questions.
My goal is to demonstrate proficiency in both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of data-driven economic analysis, preparing me to tackle real-world problems in actuarial science and beyond.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This portfolio leverages the following tools and technologies:

Show Image Python — Primary programming language

📂 Repository Structure
Each folder contains coursework, labs, and projects organized by topic. Inside, you'll find Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis, code documentation, and interpretations of results.

🚀 What I'm Learning
Through this course, I'm developing expertise in:

Moving from correlation to causation using econometric techniques
Applying regularization methods (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) to prevent overfitting
Using cross-validation and model selection strategies for robust predictions
Scaling statistical methods to handle high-dimensional economic data
Communicating technical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences


📫 Connect With Me
I'm actively seeking opportunities in Actuarial Science where I can apply these analytical skills to solve real business problems. Feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate to reach out with questions or opportunities!
